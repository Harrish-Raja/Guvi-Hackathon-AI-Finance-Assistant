✅ This version is **fully safe**, all Markdown-friendly, with a clean folder structure, plain ASCII architecture arrows, and will render perfectly on GitHub.

If you want, I can also **add professional GitHub badges at the top** (React, Python, MIT License, Stars, Forks) so it looks super polished.  

Do you want me to do that next?
